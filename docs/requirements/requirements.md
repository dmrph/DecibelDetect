## 2. Product Description

**DecibelDetect** is a web and mobile application designed to map noise pollution in urban environments. By allowing users to upload the decibel level of their current area (using the smartphone mic), DecibelDetect captures real-time noise data and visualizes it on an interactive map. Users are then able to identify and navigate away from the noisy areas, promoting quieter and healthier urban living spaces.

DecibelDetect aims to empower people from cities/suburbs with the ability to understand and navigate the sounds of their environment. While other noise mapping tools exist, they often rely on non-real-time data or are limited in geographic scope. DecibelDetect differentiates itself by providing real-time noise level readings contributed by a community of users, offering a comprehensive, up-to-date map of urban noise pollution. This community-driven approach enhances data accuracy, coverage, and user engagement.

### Major Features:
- Heatmap to display areas with greater noise pollution.
- Data/decibel upload using smartphones.
- Live map updates.
- Abillity to see history of sound pollution in different areas

### Goals:
- Scale the application to fill more use cases.
- Integration of social media elements to allow audio sharing.

## 3. Use Cases (Functional Requirements)

Each team member must come up with and describe at least one use case of the product, following this template:

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### Security:
- User data must be securely stored with appropriate security measures to prevent data misuse.

### Scalability:
- The application must handle a large number of users uploading noise data. A low number of users would make the map inaccurate due to limited data.

### Usability:
- The app should provide a clean, intuitive user interface, enabling easy data uploads and detection of noisy areas. The focus should be on simplicity, avoiding clutter.

## 5. External Requirements

- The product must be robust against errors that can reasonably be expected to occur, such as invalid
user input.
- The product must be installable by a user, or if the product is a web-based service, the server must
have a public URL that others can use to access it. If the product is a stand-alone application, you
are expected to provide a reasonable means for others to easily download, install, and run it.
- The software (all parts, including clients and servers) should be buildable from source by others. If
your project is a web-based server, you will need to provide instructions for someone else setting up a
new server. Your system should be well documented to enable new developers to make enhancements.
- The scope of the project must match the resources (number of team members) assigned.

## 6. Team Process Description

### Software Toolset:
- Define and justify the software toolset used, including programming languages, data sources, project trackers, and other tools.
