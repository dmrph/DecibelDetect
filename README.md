# DecibelDetect

DecibelDetect is a community-driven application aimed at helping users upload and visualize noise pollution data in urban areas. Users can record noise levels using their smartphones and submit the data in decibels to our platform. This allows for the creation of real-time noise maps, helping individuals find quieter areas or avoid noise-polluted zones.

## Features
- **Noise Data Upload**: Users can record noise levels using their smartphone's microphone and upload the data in decibels.
- **Noise Maps**: View uploaded noise data visualized on a map, showing high and low noise areas in real time.
- **Community-Driven**: Contributions from users help build a dynamic map of noise pollution in various regions.
- **Historical Data**: View past trends in noise pollution over time.
- **Noise Alerts**: Get notifications when you're approaching a high-noise zone.

## How It Works
1. **Record**: Use your smartphone to measure noise levels in decibels.
2. **Upload**: Submit the recorded data through the app to contribute to the noise map.
3. **View**: Check the map to see areas with high or low noise pollution.
4. **Plan**: Use the data to find quieter areas in your city or neighborhood.
